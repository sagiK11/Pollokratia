### General Description
A cross platform mobile app that aims to improve the current government - citizens communication.
In further details, Pollokratia provides a list of tasks/rules to promote.
Theses tasks can be pushed up or be pushed down by each user.
The ideal is that top rated tasks should be prioritize first by the decision makers.
Each task has two articles attached:
- An article that tries to convice why the user should upvote this task.
- An article that tries to convice why the user should downvote this task.

The tasks can be created by each user as long it applies to the app terms of use policy,

## Fine Print
Currently, the implementation of the app in the market is not doable since the register process can not assure each citizen will have one user.
The importance of the latter is crucial to make sure that each user can vote only once on each task.
